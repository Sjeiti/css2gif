# MC Picker

*a minimal color picker*

Just add the script and the colorpicker will work on any `input[type=color]`. Even if you add them to DOM afterwards.

The implementation is minimal, the code is minimal, even the colorpicker itself is a mere six elements in a wrapper and some smart CSS.


## Installation

To install just do something like:

npm i -S mc_picker

Then just import it somewhere:

import 'mc_picker'
